This is a (github) fork of the trac_ik package at https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik

The ROS packages in this repository were created to provide an alternative
Inverse Kinematics solver to the popular inverse Jacobian methods in KDL.
Specifically, KDL's convergence algorithms are based on Newton's method, which
does not work well in the presence of joint limits --- common for many robotic
platforms.  TRAC-IK concurrently runs two IK implementations.  One is a simple
extension to KDL's Newton-based convergence algorithm that detects and
mitigates local minima due to joint limits by random jumps.  The second is an
SQP (Sequential Quadratic Programming) nonlinear optimization approach which
uses quasi-Newton methods that better handle joint limits.  Currently, the IK
search returns immediately when either of these algorithms converges to an
answer.  Future work plans to allow secondary constraints and sorting
functions to be provided to the main TRAC-IK call in order to receive back the
"best" IK solution.

###This repo contains 3 ROS packages:###

- trac\_ik is a metapackage with build and [Changelog](https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik/src/HEAD/trac_ik/CHANGELOG.rst) info.

- [trac\_ik\_lib](https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik/src/HEAD/trac_ik_lib), the TRAC-IK kinematics code,
builds a .so library that can be used as a drop in replacement for KDL's IK
functions for KDL chains. Details for use are in trac\_ik\_lib/README.md.

- [trac\_ik\_kinematics\_plugin](https://bitbucket.org/traclabs/trac_ik/src/HEAD/trac_ik_kinematics_plugin) builds a [MoveIt! plugin](http://moveit.ros.org/documentation/concepts/#kinematics) that can
replace the default KDL plugin for MoveIt! with TRAC-IK for use in planning.
Details for use are in trac\_ik\_kinematics\_plugin/README.md. (Note prior to v1.1.2, the plugin was not thread safe.)

###A detailed writeup on TRAC-IK can be found here:###

[Humanoids-2015](https://personal.traclabs.com/~pbeeson/publications/b2hd-Beeson-humanoids-15.html) (reported results are from v1.0.0 of TRAC-IK, see below for newer results).

###Some sample results are below: 

_Orocos' **KDL**_ (inverse Jacobian w/ joint limits), _**KDL-RR**_ (our fixes to KDL joint limit handling), and _**TRAC-IK**_ (our concurrent inverse Jacobian and non-linear optimization solver; Speed mode) are compared below.

IK success and average speed (for successful solves) as of TRAC-IK tag v1.3.2.  All results are from 10,000 randomly generated, reachable joint configurations.  Full 3D pose IK was requested at 1e-5 Cartesian error for x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw with a maximum solve time of 5 ms.  All IK queries are seeded from the chain's "nominal" pose midway between joint limits.

**Note on success**: Neither KDL nor TRAC-IK uses any mesh information to determine if _valid_ IK solutions result in self-collisions.  IK solutions deal with link distances and joint ranges, and remain agnostic about self-collisions due to volumes.  Expected future enhancements to TRAC-IK that search for multiple solutions may also include the ability to throw out solutions that result in self collisions (provided the URDF has valid geometry information); however, this is currently not the behaviour of any generic IK solver examined to date.

**Note on timings**: The timings provided include both successful and unsuccessful runs.  When an IK solution is not found, the numerical IK solver implementations will run for the full timeout requested, searching for an answer; thus for robot chains where KDL fails much of the time (e.g., Jaco-2), the KDL times are skewed towards the user requested timeout value (here 5 ms).
